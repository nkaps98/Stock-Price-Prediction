# üìä Time Series Stock Price Prediction using Fuzzy-LSTM and Transfer Learning

This repository contains the code and methodology for a project completed as part of the **AI6124: Neuroevolution and Fuzzy Intelligence** course at **Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**.

We developed a hybrid **Fuzzy-LSTM** model for stock price forecasting, applied **transfer learning** across different financial assets, and evaluated performance using **RMSE** and **portfolio returns**.

---

## üîç Problem Statement

Stock price prediction is challenging due to:
- High volatility and noise
- Non-stationary data distributions
- Complex dependencies between economic and behavioral factors

Traditional approaches often ignore the **non-stationary** nature of stock data, resulting in poor predictive reliability.

---

## ‚úÖ Our Contributions

1. **Stationary Transformation**:  
   Instead of predicting absolute prices, we used a **price differencing approach** to make the data stationary.

2. **Modeling Techniques**:
   - **Random Walk** (Baseline)
   - **LSTM** (Benchmark Deep Learning model)
   - **Fuzzy-LSTM**: Hybrid model incorporating fuzzy logic for uncertainty handling
   - **Transfer Learning**: Trained FLSTM on Autodesk (ADSK) and fine-tuned on NVIDIA (NVDA)

3. **Portfolio Return Calculation**:  
   Trading signals were derived using SMA crossover and evaluated using multiplicative portfolio returns.

## üìà Results Summary

| Model               | RMSE   | Portfolio Returns |
|--------------------|--------|-------------------|
| Random Walk        | 7.50   | 1.0147            |
| LSTM               | 4.71   | 1.1843            |
| Fuzzy-LSTM         | 3.92   | 1.1983            |
| FLSTM + Transfer   | 3.89   | **1.1990**        |

- Transfer learning improved generalization and required minimal retraining.
- Fuzzy logic helped handle uncertainty in noisy market data.
- The hybrid model outperformed traditional baselines in both **accuracy** and **profitability**.
